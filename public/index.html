The HTML contents have moved. The header is in
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

and the body is in
app/views/hubbub/feed.html.erb

The templates are in
app/assets/javascripts/templates.js.coffee

(I think serving everything through Rails routes/controllers makes more
sense than using public/ for some web requests and the controllers for
others. Also, this lets us use partials and ERB helpers like csrf_meta_tags)
